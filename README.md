# Restaurant Cerasus

## Overview of the project:

- A fictional multi-page restaurant project named after my hometown.

- There are a few things to add, such as nicer button effects, a logo, etc.

- Designed using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. 

- Used the glide.js library for the carousel on the homepage and other than that, the project consists of vanilla JavaScript.

- Once the project is entirely finished, code refactoring will be made.
